				While I love everything that Ze Frank says in this video, one segment in
				particular hits home for me:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				Let me think about the people who I care about the most. And how when they
				fail or disappoint me, I still love them; I still give them chances; and I
				still see the best in them. Let me extend that generocity to myself.
			</blockquote>

				I can personally attest that having the love of a dog is one of the most
				rewarding things in the world. I think there is much we can learn from
				the joy that comes from such love. And, how we can change the lives of
				others through the offering of our own love.

				This video is a reminder that we all have an opportunity to be a leader
				in our own context, regardless of what our role is. Leadership is about
				how we choose to see ourselves and the people around us.
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Leadership is a choice - it is not a rank. I know many people at the
					senior-most levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. 
					They are "authorities"; and, we do what they say because they have 
					authority over us. But, we would not follow them.
				</p>

				<p>
					And I know many people who are at the bottom of organizations, who
					have no authority and they are absolutely leaders. And, this is
					because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of 
					them; and, they have chosen to look after the person to the right of
					them. This is what a leader is.
				</p>

				Every one of Steve Hartman's "On The Road" stories is inspiring. But,

				small gestures can have on people who are in dire need of kindness.

				While I appreciate that this poem (authored by Marianne Williamson)
				speaks to being powerful, the part that resonates the most with me is
				last line: that a facet of our power is the ability to liberate others
				through our actions:
			</p>

			<blockquote>			
				<p>
					... and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other
					people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own
					fear, our presence automatically liberates other.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				I find this to be particularly imporant in a work environment. As someone
				who is unlikely to get fired from my company, I try to be the first one
				to admit ignorance and doubt; or, to ask challenging questions. I try to 
				sacrifice myself on the alter of dignity, such that others may feel
				comfortable doing and feeling the same.
