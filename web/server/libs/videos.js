				While I love everything that Ze Frank says in this video, one segment in
				particular hits home for me:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				Let me think about the people who I care about the most. And how when they
				fail or disappoint me, I still love them; I still give them chances; and I
				still see the best in them. Let me extend that generocity to myself.

				I can personally attest that having the love of a dog is one of the most
				rewarding things in the world. I think there is much we can learn from
				the joy that comes from such love. And, how we can change the lives of
				others through the offering of our own love.

				This video is a reminder that we all have an opportunity to be a leader
				in our own context, regardless of what our role is. Leadership is about
				how we choose to see ourselves and the people around us.
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Leadership is a choice - it is not a rank. I know many people at the
					senior-most levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. 
					They are "authorities"; and, we do what they say because they have 
					authority over us. But, we would not follow them.
				</p>

				<p>
					And I know many people who are at the bottom of organizations, who
					have no authority and they are absolutely leaders. And, this is
					because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of 
					them; and, they have chosen to look after the person to the right of
					them. This is what a leader is.
				</p>
